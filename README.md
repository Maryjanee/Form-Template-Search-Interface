### This project isnt completed yet. I'll highlight a few things that I would do if i had more time.

- The data being retrieved from the API is a large one and although I created functionality to limit the content being displayed to the user, managing the data in the browser has proven inefficient as the application keeps crashing in development. I have therefore decided to create a server to retrieve the data from the API and also add logic to paginate the resulting data and have it sent to frontend React app in slices and I believe this would go a long way in optimizing the application and make it function properly.

- Once managing the retrieved data is acheived , i would go on to add functionality to search through the templates and functionality to sort these templates as specified by the user.

- I would also want to work more on styling the app as I have just added only the basic styles to get the app running.
