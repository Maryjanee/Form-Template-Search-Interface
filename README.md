This project isnt completed yet and here, I'll highlight a few things that I would do if i had more time.

- The data coming in is a large one therefore I created a Paginate component for to limit the content being displayed to the user. However, this has proven inefficient as the browser keeps crashing in development. I have therefor decided to create a server to retrieve the data from the API and also add logic to paginate the resulting data and have it sent to frontend React app in slices and I believe this would go a long way in optimizing the application and make it function properly.

Once this is sorted, i would go on to add functionality to search through the templates and functionality to sort these templates as specified by the user.

I would also want to work more on styling the app as I have just added only the basic styles to get the app running.
